Obsolete
========

The following was written for previous versions of Autothing.  I'm
leaving it here for now because I'll likely canibalize it for other
bits of documentation, either for Autothing itself, the `files`
module, or the `dist` module.

High-level overview
-------------------

It also makes it easy to follow the GNU standards for your makefiles:
it takes care of this entire table of .PHONY targets for you:

| this | and this         | are aliases for this                                   |
|------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| all  | build            | $(outdir)/build                                        |
|      | install          | $(outdir)/install                                      |
|      | uninstall        | $(outdir)/uninstall                                    |
|      | mostlyclean      | $(outdir)/mostlyclean                                  |
|      | clean            | $(outdir)/clean                                        |
|      | distclean        | $(outdir)/distclean                                    |
|      | maintainer-clean | $(outdir)/maintainer-clean                             |
|      | check            | $(outdir)/check (not implemented for you)              |
|      | dist             | $(topoutdir)/$(PACKAGE)-$(VERSION).tar.gz (not .PHONY) |

(You are still responsible for implementing the `$(outdir)/check`
target in each of your Makefiles.)
