# [0]: There is no INSTALLFLAGS because it would be inconsistent with how the
#      standards otherwise recommend using $(INSTALL); with INSTALL_PROGRAM and
#      INSTALL_DATA; which are specified in a way precluding the use of
#      INSTALLFLAGS.  To have the variable, but to ignore it in the common case
#      would be confusing.
#
# [1]: The RANLIB and LDCONFIG variables need some extra smarts; §7.2.2 says:
#
#       > When you use ranlib or ldconfig, you should make sure nothing bad
#       > happens if the system does not have the program in question. Arrange
#       > to ignore an error from that command, and print a message before the
#       > command to tell the user that failure of this command does not mean a
#       > problem. (The Autoconf ‘AC_PROG_RANLIB’ macro can help with this.)
